trackmyplugins
==============

script that connects to several api's to collect download data

the problem: tracking downloads of your plugins from several sources:
 - wordpress plugins
 - firefox extensions
 - chrome extensions
 - custom downloads tracked by bit.ly

the solution: 
 - simple perl script with all four scrapers, utilizing Mechanize library
 - configure the list of plugins from simple text file
 - configure your secrets from simple text file (keep it safe!)
 - sqlite3 database with dates and #downloads for each plugin
 - simple flask script that serves the data via json API

see it live at http://ceo.io/zemanta/downloads/

to install:
 - clone this repository somewhere where you will be able to access it online
 - flush test.db
 - edit plugins.txt
 - rename secrets-example.txt to secrets.txt and fill it out
 - install perl depencancies: `sudo cpan JSON IO::Socket::SSL WWW::Mechanize DBD::SQLite LWP::Protocol::https`
 - edit agregator.pl to enable $history=1 and run once to collect the history. edit back.
 - configure crontab to run the agregator.pl daily
 - visit the url and test the api

API
 - index.cgi support some basic api calls:
 - ?daily=1 spits out json object with all data from yesterday
 - ?daily=1&date=2013-04-03 spits out json object with data from given date
